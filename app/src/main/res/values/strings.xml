        \n\nFirst, a player will be chosen at random to start. The green arrow will indicate which player\'s turn it is.\n\nThe first player will
        take a picture using the \"Take a Picture!\" button. The next player will then take their picture, trying to match the first picture\'s
        color to the best of their ability. The closer you match the color, the more points you will be awarded!\n\nThe player that ended the
        previous round will then take the first picture on the second round, and both players will continue to take turns taking the first picture
        and matching with the second. The game ends after each player has gone first 3 times.\n\nThe player with the most points at the end of the game wins!</string>
